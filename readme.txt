Hello Planet,

This is my assigment submission for your Developer position.

You can get the project repository at
https://github.com/joordaz/planet001

There is a precompiled JAR file in
https://github.com/joordaz/planet001/tree/master/out/artifacts/planet001jar

To use  the program you just invoke from command line:
java -var planet001.jar inputfilename sortorder

Only the file name parameter is mandatory.
The sort order is optional, could be any of the letters: F, L or D
(to sort by First name, Last name or start Date respectively)
If you only provide the file name the output will be sorted by first name.

If you dont specify any parameters the program will tell you what is needed.

Waiting for your feedback.

Thanks!
